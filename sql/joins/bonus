# Employee Bonus (MySQL example)

Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-bonus/

Problem: report the name and bonus amount of each employee where the bonus is less than 1000.
Return the result table in any order. If an employee has no bonus record, the bonus should appear as NULL.

Sample input tables

Employee table:

| empId | name   | supervisor | salary |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| 3     | Brad   | NULL       | 4000   |
| 1     | John   | 3          | 1000   |
| 2     | Dan    | 3          | 2000   |
| 4     | Thomas | 3          | 4000   |

Bonus table:

| empId | bonus |
|-------|-------|
| 2     | 500   |
| 4     | 2000  |

Expected output (any order):

| name | bonus |
|------|-------|
| Brad | NULL  |
| John | NULL  |
| Dan  | 500   |

Explanation

- Use a LEFT JOIN from `employee` to `bonus` to keep all employees. Employees without a matching bonus row will have `b.bonus = NULL`.
- Filter to rows where `b.bonus < 1000` (employees with small bonuses) OR `b.bonus IS NULL` (employees with no bonus record).

MySQL query

```sql
SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN bonus b
  ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL;
```

Notes

- This solution is portable to most SQL dialects (use `LEFT JOIN` and `IS NULL`).
- If you want to exclude employees with no bonus, drop the `b.bonus IS NULL` condition.
