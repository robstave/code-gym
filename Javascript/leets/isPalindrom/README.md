TRY to do with out converting to string


Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_ _**palindrome**_ _, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -121
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 10
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

So in this example, there is an isPalindrome2.  This was suggested by AI, but it does not deal with the "no string" constraint.   My fault.  I did not ask
