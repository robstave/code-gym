## Functions Taking JSON Input

Some exercises accept an array of JSON objects (logs). Typical shape:

- Required fields:
	- `userId` (string)
	- `action` (string)

- Optional fields (may appear, should be ignored unless needed):
	- `timestamp` (number|string)
	- `metadata` (object)

Implementations should only rely on the required fields and tolerate extra properties.
